It is the equivalent of a physical point-of-sale (pos) terminal in a shop or restaurant. It lets your customer submit their credit card details and then securely passes this information from the customer to the merchant and then between the merchant and the bank. You can start to take debit and credit card payments through our card machine.</p> -->
